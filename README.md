## Why Athena?

Self-learning with Google, YouTube, and Reddit is difficult because there's so much noise. If you Google "learn programming", half of the results are ads and the other half are products like Codecademy and media companies saying "you should learn how to code." There's a bit of signal, but it's mostly noise. Even if you're serious about self-learning, it's hard to focus and not get caught up in random rabbit holes.

The best way to learn on the Internet is to get people who already know what you're trying to learn about recommend the best resources. This is ideal if you know a subject expert, but if you don't, Athena's the next best thing.

## Contributing to this collection

**Step 1.** Find a learning resource that's both useful and interesting.  
**Step 2.** Stress-test the resource's quality, by using it yourself.  
**Step 3.** If the resource is ðŸ”¥, click on the [`collection.md`](/collection.md) file.  
**Step 4.** Now click on the edit icon on the top right (it looks like a pencil).  
**Step 5.** You can start editing the text of the file in the in-browser editor. Make sure you follow the guidelines below. You can use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/).  
**Step 6.** Say why you're proposing the changes, then click on "Propose file change".  
**Step 7.** Finally, submit the [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)!  

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Make sure the link is useful before submitting. Athena's value comes from curation, not aggregation.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Follow the template shown in the spreadsheet [below](#recent-submissions).
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Thank you for your suggestions!
