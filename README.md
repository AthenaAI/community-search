## Why Athena?

Self-learning with Google, YouTube, and Reddit is difficult because there's so much noise. If you Google "learn programming", half of the results are ads and the other half are products like Codecademy and media companies saying "you should learn how to code." There's a bit of signal, but it's mostly noise. Even if you're serious about self-learning, it's hard to focus and not get caught up in random rabbit holes.

The best way to learn on the Internet is to get people who already know what you're trying to learn about recommend the best resources. This is ideal if you know a subject expert, but if you don't, Athena's the next best thing.
